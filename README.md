# Pepper Core Animations

This is a collection of animations for Pepper the robot, that can be useful for various (QiSDK) applications.

See https://developer.softbankrobotics.com/pepper-qisdk for more on making applications for Pepper.

## Usage

Import the animations into your Android project, for more details see
[here](https://developer.softbankrobotics.com/pepper-qisdk/api/motion/tutorials/mimic-animal-animate)
for explanations on running animations.

## Animation Families

The animations are grouped by family depending on your use case; families usually have several animations so Pepper's moves can be randomized a bit:

 * **00-BackToStand**
 * **01-Hello**
 * **02-Body_Parts** - to point to various body parts
 * **03-Tablet** - to point to Pepper's tablet
 * **04-Make_Space** - to use before a dance or wide movement
 * **05-Enumeration**
 * **06-Solitaries** - some animations that can be played when Pepper has nothing else to do
 * **07-Reactions**
 * **08-Attract**
 * **09-Orientation** - pointing in various directions
 * **10-Loading** - poses between which to cycle while Pepper is loading something


Each folder has a Readme.txt with more details.
